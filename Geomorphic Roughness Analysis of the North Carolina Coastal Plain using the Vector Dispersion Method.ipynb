    "The world's coastal plains are the present day subaerial expressions of the continental margins. With the rise and fall of eustatic and regional sea level, there is a back and forth exchange between the coastal plains and their submerged counterparts, the continental shelves, each one gaining or losing landscape/seascape based on these sea level shifts and the concomitant changes in the ocean shoreline position.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways to approach the problem of geomorphically and geographically mapping the subaerial continental coastal plain, but perhaps the most likely to meet with success is some measure of surface texture or roughness. Roughness can be thought of, from a geostatistical perspective as a measure of variance. Areas presenting more topographic expression (e.g., hillslopes, valley and ridge) display more variation in elevation and in turn, dericative slopes and curvatures. Areas where topographic expression is more subdued, such as the coastal plains that are the subject of the present research, display less over variance n the landscape. I hope to be able to exploit thhis difference in some meaningful and quantitiative way to first geomorphologically identify and then map the continental coastal plains (those present-day subaerial extensions of the continental margins) across the North American Continent. \n",

    "To do this then, I need to know how to quantify and then measure topographic variance or roughness. How do I do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Grohmann, Smith, and Riccomini, (2011) identify six separate measures (there are others) of topographic surface roughness: 1.) area ratio, 2.) vector dispersion, 3.) standard deviation of residual topography, 4.) standard deviation of elevation, 5.) standard deviation of slope, and 6.) standard deviation of profile curvature. The authors tested the efficacy of the sextet in describing the textural landscape for a region in Scotland. In this notebook, I will apply the vector dispersion method toward assessing the potential to offer a unique roughness signature for identifying and mapping the world's coasts (coastal plains). \n",
    "\n",
    "*In this notebook I compute the roughness values for a section of the North Carolina coastal plain using the Vector Dispersion Method as outlined by Grohmann, Smith, and Riccomini. The geography selected is the county of Halifax, North Carolina. Halifax County is ideally (I hope) positioned such that it is intersected by the 'Fall-line' that marks the boundary between coastal plain and piedmont regions.  The strength (or weakness) of the contrast seen between the two regions and the potential of the vector dispersion method to reveal a unique signature for identifying the coastal plain, and mapping it will be assessed.*"

Based on the dispersion as dipicted on the map and surface profile (running approx NW to SE), if we are assuming that the landscape of the coastal plain is smoother than that of its adjacent piedmont neighbor, then either: 1.) vector dispersion is much too sensitive to micro-scale topography, or 2.) our assumption is incorrect,  or 3.) I made a mistake somewhere in the computation stream...\n",

I continue to hold out that there are differences, though those differences are more subtle and likely manifest through a more elaborate construct than surface complexity. Vector dispersion is simply not the right tool for bringing this to light."
