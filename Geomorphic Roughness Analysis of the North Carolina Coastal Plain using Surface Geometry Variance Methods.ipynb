    "In this notebook we will further explore (carrying on from notebook: Geomorphic Roughness Analysis of the North Carolina Coastal Plain using Vector Dispersion Methods) the assumption that the coastal plain province, and coastal plains in general, present a less topographicall varied (i.e. rough) character than do the interior uplands [onto which the coastal plains abut). Here, we will look at the spatial distribution of variance in surface character (via elevation, slopes, and curvatures) that might suggest a signal to discriminate coastal plain from upland (piedmont). \n",
